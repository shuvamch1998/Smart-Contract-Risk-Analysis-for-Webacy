Smart Contract Risk and Cluster Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of smart contracts, focusing on risk profiling and clustering techniques. The project applies various clustering algorithms to assess the risk of different contract clusters, utilizing both statistical and machine learning methods. The aim is to provide actionable insights for risk mitigation in smart contracts.

Project Overview

Objective
To explore and analyze the risk profiles of smart contracts using clustering techniques.
To provide tailored risk mitigation strategies based on the characteristics of each cluster.
Data Preprocessing
Standardization: Applied using StandardScaler to normalize the dataset.
PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Performed to reduce dimensionality, retaining 95% variance.
Feature Selection: A total of 35 features are selected for analysis, including attributes like contract ownership, audit frequency, and external dependencies.

Clustering Techniques

K-Means Clustering
Optimal Clusters: Determined using the Elbow Method.
Silhouette Score: Achieved a score of 0.4749 for 9 clusters.
Visualization: Clusters visualized on the first two PCA components.

Hierarchical Clustering
Linkage Method: Complete linkage used for clustering.
Silhouette Score: 0.4368, slightly lower than K-Means.
Dendrogram: Visualized the hierarchical structure of clusters.

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
Parameters: Eps = 0.7, Min Samples = 5.
Silhouette Score: 0.2961, indicating lower performance compared to other methods.
Visualization: Clusters plotted on PCA components.

Risk Profile Analysis
High-Risk Clusters: Clusters 2, 3, and 6 demonstrate high centralized risk and external dependencies, requiring robust security measures such as decentralized governance and regular contract audits.
Moderate-Risk Clusters: Clusters 0 and 5 exhibit moderate risk, suggesting a combination of proactive measures like bug bounty programs and continuous monitoring.
Low-Risk Clusters: Clusters 1, 4, 7, and 8 show low risk, focusing on optimizing performance while maintaining a vigilant security posture.

Correlation Analysis
Correlation heatmaps visualize relationships between the PCA components.
Applied K-Means clustering on the correlation matrix for further grouping.

Key Features
Dimensionality Reduction with PCA: Reduces the dataset to its most significant features while retaining critical variance.
Multiple Clustering Algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN clustering techniques for comparison.
Risk Profiling: Provides detailed risk assessment for each cluster, aiding in the identification of vulnerable smart contracts.
Risk Mitigation Strategies: Custom strategies suggested for high, medium, and low-risk clusters.
